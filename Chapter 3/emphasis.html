    <ol><h3>HTML provides four phrasing elements to emphasize text within the body of a document</h3>
        <li>Text enclosed between -b- tags are enhanced without conveying extra importance - just visual</li>
        <li>Text enclosed between -i- tags is enhanced without conveying extra importance - just visual</li>
        <li>Text enclosed between -strong- tags gains increased importance</li>
        <li>Text enclosed between -em- tags gains increased importance</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use -strong- and -em- tags. The -b- tag should be avoided wherever possible, but one legitimate use is to mark up the lead sentence of an article.</p>

        <strong>Warning:</strong>
        This dungeon is dangerous.
        <strong>Avoid the ducks.</strong>
        Take any gold you find.
        <strong>Do not take any diamonds, they are explosive.</strong> You have been warned.
