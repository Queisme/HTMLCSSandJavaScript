• The Document Object Model (DOM) is a hierarchical tree representation of
all components of a web page.
• The window object is the top level in the DOM hierarchy and has properties
describing the browser window.
• The screen object is a child of the window object and has properties describing
the screen dimensions and color depth.
• The window object has scrollBy( ) and scrollTo( ) methods and scrollX and scrollY
properties that specify the scroll position.
• Dialog messages can be displayed using the window object’s alert( ), confirm( ),
and prompt( ) methods.
• A pop-up window can be created using the window object’s open( ) method,
but may be obstructed by a pop-up blocker.
• The window object’s setTimeout( ) method creates a timer, which can be
canceled later using the clearTimeout( ) method.
• The navigator object is a child of the window object and has properties
describing the browser and host platform versions.
• The window object exists in the global namespace so all its child objects need
not include the window part of the address.
• Feature detection is used to identify the modern DOM.
• The navigator.plugins and navigator.mimeTypes properties are arrays that contain
details of supported features.
• The location object is a child of the window object and has properties
describing the address of the loaded document.
• The history object is a child of the window object that contains an array of
visited locations in the current session.
• The history object has back( ), forward( ), and go( ) methods that are used to
move through pages in the current session.
