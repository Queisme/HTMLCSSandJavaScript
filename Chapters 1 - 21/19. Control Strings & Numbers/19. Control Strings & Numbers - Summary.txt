• The Math object provides mathematical constants, such as Math.PI, and
mathematical methods, such as Math.max( )
• Floating-point numbers can be rounded to the nearest integer using Math.floor(
), Math.ceil( ), and Math.round( ) methods.
• JavaScript does not provide automatic rounding to overcome floating-point
discrepancies.
• Multiply floating-point values by 100, perform the arithmetic, then divide the
result by 100 to avoid discrepancy errors.
• The Math.random( ) method returns a random floating-point number between
0.0 and 1.0.
• Multiplying a random floating-point number by 10 and rounding the result
with Math.ceil( ) makes the range 1-10.
• The String object provides useful methods to manipulate string values, such as
toUpperCase( ) and toLowerCase( )
• Each string has a length property containing an integer that is the total number
of characters in that string.
• Strings can be joined together using the + concatenation operator or the string
concat( ) method.
• The eval( ) built-in function can have security implications so is best avoided.
• The slice( ) and substring( ) method arguments specify start and end positions,
but those of the substr( ) method specify the start position and the number of
characters to copy.
• The split( ) method returns an array of all substrings that exist between
occurrences of the character specified as its argument.
• The search( ), match( ), indexOf( ), lastIndexOf( ), and charAt( ) methods can be
used to seek characters within a string.
• The trim( ) method removes whitespace from both ends of a string.
• The startsWith( ), endsWith( ), and includes( ) methods seek a case-sensitive
match within a string.• The replace( ) and repeat( ) methods create modified strings.
