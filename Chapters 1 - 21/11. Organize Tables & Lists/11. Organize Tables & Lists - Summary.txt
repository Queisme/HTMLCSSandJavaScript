• A web browser can quickly draw a fixed layout table by assessing the width
of the table and its first row of cells.
• A table caption-side can be specified as top or bottom.
• A border-spacing can specify the distance between table cell borders as a
uniform distance or as horizontal and vertical.
• The empty-cells property can hide any cell that contains absolutely no content.
• The border-collapse property can combine adjacent borders of a table and its
cells into a single border.
• The display property can specify that a selected element should be treated by
the browser as a table component.
• A list-style-type can specify the type of marker to be used for list items as
bullets, numbers or letters.
• The CSS url( ) function can specify the path to an image for use as a list
marker.
• A list-style-position can specify whether markers should appear inside or
outside the list’s content box.
• A navigation bar is a list of hyperlinks with particular CSS style rules applied
to an HTML list element.
• When a hyperlink is displayed as a block, its entire content box is clickable.
• Pseudo-classes can be used to indicate the status of hyperlinks.
• Vertical navigation bars specify a list width, but horizontal navigation bars
float the list items and hide the overflow.
• A dropdown box is a content box that is hidden until the user places the cursor
over an active element.
• An dropdown’s active element should be relatively positioned so the
dropdown box can be absolutely positioned beneath it.
