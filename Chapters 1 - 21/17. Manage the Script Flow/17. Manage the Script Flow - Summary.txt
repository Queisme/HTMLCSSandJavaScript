• The basic conditional test is performed with the if keyword to test a condition
for a boolean true or false value.
• An alternative branch to the basic conditional test can be provided by
extending an if statement with the else keyword.
• A large number of conditions can be tested for a boolean true or false value
with a switch statement.
• In a switch block, each case statement must end with the break keyword to
exit when a match is found.
• A switch block may contain a final default statement to execute when no
match has been found.
• A for loop must specify an initializer, a condition to be tested for a boolean
true or false value, and a modifier.
• A loop modifier must enable the tested condition to become false at some
point in order to exit the loop.
• The while loops and for loops evaluate a test condition before any statements
are executed.
• A do while loop evaluates a test condition after its statements have been
executed.
• The break keyword can be used to exit from a loop when a specified condition
is encountered.
• The continue keyword can be used to skip a single iteration of a loop when a
specified condition is encountered.
• The try catch structure can be used to handle exception errors that occur in a
script.
• Each error object can have a name property and a message property to allow
the catch block to describe its nature.
• A string may be passed to the catch block by the throw keyword to identify the
error.
• A try catch structure may be followed by a finally block containing statementsto execute after exceptions are handled.
