• CSS is a language provided by the W3C to regain control of markup by
separating document structure from presentation.
• The cascade allows style rules to fall from one style sheet to another and
determines which style rule will be applied.
• Each style rule comprises a selector and a declaration block.
• Each declaration specifies a property and a value to be applied to that
property – separated by a : colon character.
• A style rule set may contain multiple declarations – each terminated by a ;
semicolon character.
• Style rules can be specified in an internal style sheet, inline to an HTML
element’s style attribute, or in an external style sheet.
• Type selectors select all elements that match the selector.
• Class selectors select all elements that contain a class attribute that has been
assigned a value matching the selector.
• Identity selectors select all elements that contain an id attribute that has been
assigned a value matching the selector.
• Relative selectors are combinators that select elements relative to other
elements as descendants, children, or siblings.
• Attribute selectors select elements that have specific attributes or particular
attribute values.
• The cascade evaluates the selector’s specificity to rate importance by how
specifically each one targets the element.
• Color values can be specified by name, hexadecimal value, Red Green Blue
value or Hue, Saturation, Lightness value.
• The background shorthand property can specify an element’s background
color, image, repeat, position, and attachment.
