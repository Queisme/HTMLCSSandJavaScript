• Responsive Web Design (RWD) aims to ensure web pages present content
well and perform well across all devices.
• Responsive Web Design uses media queries to determine the size and
capabilities of the viewing device.
• Pages optimized for Responsive Web Design must include the <meta>
viewport tag in the document’s head section.
• Responsive Web Design requirements can be satisfied using the flexbox
layout scheme and grid layout scheme.
• The flexbox layout scheme places items in rows, but the grid layout scheme
places items in both rows and columns.
• The optimum solution for Responsive Web Design invariably uses a
combination of the grid and flexbox layout schemes.
• It is good practice to design for mobile first, as more web pages are now
viewed on mobile devices than desktop PCs.
• A responsive web page can be made to adapt its layout for devices that have
larger display areas by adding media queries.
• Media queries can be used to specify different versions of an image for
devices of different size.
• Background images can be made to scale down by specifying the contain
keyword to the background-size property, and the no-repeat keyword to the
background-repeat property.
• Images and video can be made to scale up or down by specifying a
percentage value to their width property and the auto keyword to their height
property.
• Content can be hidden and removed from the page flow by specifying the
none keyword to the display property.
• The visibility and opacity properties can be used to hide content but they each
reserve space on the web page.
• Content can be hidden from view and remain visible to screen readerswithout reserving page space by absolutely positioning the content outside
the display area.
