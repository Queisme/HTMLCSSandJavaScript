<h1>The Statue of Liberty</h1>

<p>The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years
<br>by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi.
<br>Upon its completion in 1884 all 350 individual pieces of the statue were packed into 214 crates for the long boat ride from France to New York.</p>

<hr> 

<p>The statue arrived in the America several months later
<br>and was reconstructed on Liberty Island.
<br>Auguste Bartholdi thought that the New York harbor was the perfect setting for his masterpiece because it was where immigrants got their first view of the New World.</p>
