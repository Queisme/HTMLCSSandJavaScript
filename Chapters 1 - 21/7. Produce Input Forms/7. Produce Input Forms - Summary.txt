• HTML forms submit data to the web server as key=value pairs for processing by a specified server-side script.

• All form component elements are enclosed between <form> </form> tags, which must include an action attribute, to specify the URL of the processing script, and a method attribute to specify the submission method as GET or POST.

• Each <input> tag’s type attribute specifies its component type, such as “text”, “password”, “checkbox”, “radio”, etc.

• An <input> tag can include name and value attributes to specify data for submission as a key=value pair.

• An <input> tag can enforce its completion by including the required keyword, but many automatically prohibit submission if the user enters a value that is not permitted.

• A multi-line text field is created by <textarea> </textarea> tags that require rows and cols attributes to specify its size.

• Radio button and checkbox inputs only submit their name and value attribute data if they are checked.

• Forms can contain “hidden” elements that allow static or script-generated data to be submitted to the server for processing.

• When a form is to upload files, the <form> tag must include an enctype attribute specifying encoding as “multipart/form-data”.

• A form may be submitted by a regular submit <input> element, by an image <input> element, or by a <button> element.

• Logo images can be added to the button face by enclosing an <img> element between <button> </button> tags.

• Each form control can be enclosed between <label> </label> tags to visually group them with text for styling purposes.
