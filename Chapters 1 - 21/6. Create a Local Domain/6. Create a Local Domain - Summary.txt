The free Abyss Web Server X1 can be installed on your own PC for web
development.
• Abyss can be started manually or set to continuously run in the background
automatically.
• When Abyss is running it provides a domain named localhost that is an alias
for the IP address 127.0.0.1.
• A web server can call upon an interpreter to execute server-side scripts that
respond to requests from a web browser.
• The most popular server-side scripting languages include PHP, ASP.NET,
Ruby, Perl, and Python.
• When Python is installed you can directly interact with its interpreter
(python.exe) via the Python Console.
• Abyss must be configured to know the location of the Python interpreter
(python.exe) and to recognize that files with the file extension of .py are
Python scripts.
• The URL localhost:9999 and user credentials are needed to open the Abyss
Web Server Console.
• The CGI/ISAPI interfaces allow data to be transferred between the web
server and a script interpreter.
• The Abyss Web Server’s location on your system contains a htdocs folder
that is recognized by the localhost domain.
• HTML documents, server-side scripts, and other resource files should be
placed in the Abyss htdocs folder.
• Data can be sent to a web server by appending a query string to a requested
URL.
• Query strings begin with a ? question mark separator.
• Query strings contain one or more key=value pairs, with each pair separated
by an & ampersand character.
• A Python server-script can echo data sent to it from a browser request withina web server response.
