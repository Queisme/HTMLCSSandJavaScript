    <p>Front-end development, also known as client side development, is the practice of producing HTML documents, CSS style sheets, and JavaScript script code <span class="reference">(Figure 1)</span> for a website or Web Application - so a user can see and interact with them directly.</p>

    <figure id="back-stack">
        <img src="figure-back.png" alt="Back-end" width="160" height="128">
    <figcaption class="reference">
        Figure 2:Back-end Technologies
    </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Back-end development, also known as server-side development, is the practice of producing complex websites using programming languages such as SQL, Java, PHP, or .NET <span class="reference">(Figure 2)</span> to provide features beyond front-end capabilites.</p>

    <p>Always refer to figures only by their label - avoid using reference terms like "in the figure on the right" so the document layout can be easily changed without creating confusion.</p>
